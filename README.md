# PROJECT-8
This project is a responsive JavaScript Documentation Website built using HTML and CSS. It is designed to present technical content in a clear, structured, and easy-to-read format, similar to official programming documentation platforms. The website includes a fixed sidebar navigation menu and multiple content sections such as Introduction, JavaScript Basics, Variables, and Examples, allowing users to easily navigate through different topics.

The main goal of this project is to practice creating documentation-style layouts, improving page structure, and implementing responsive design techniques. While working on this project, I strengthened my skills in semantic HTML, CSS layout management, and user interface organization. This project serves as a learning-based implementation for understanding how professional documentation websites are designed and structured.
